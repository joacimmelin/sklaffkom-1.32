Arguments:
<number-of-lines>

Description:
The command allows you to set a screen length that matches your
terminal. Normally not needed as the screen length should
be automatically detected, but in rare cases this does
not work, and then it is automatically set to 24.

If you have already changed your screen length, but want to return to
automatic detection, enter either '0' or 'A'-

If you only give the command "Change screen length" you will be guided,
if you already know what length you want, you can enter it as an
argument instead.

Example:
'Change screen length' - helps you choose the right length.
'Change screen length 24' - sets the screen length to 24.
'Change screen length 0' - turns on automatic detection.
